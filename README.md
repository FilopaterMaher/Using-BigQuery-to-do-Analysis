# Using BigQuery to Perform Data Analysis

This repository provides an example of how to gain insights from two datasets in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using BigQuery.

## Steps to Get Started

1. **Create a GCP Account**
   - If you don't have an account, sign up at [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

2. **Access BigQuery**
   - Navigate to [BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery) from the GCP Console.

3. **Create a Project**
   - Set up a new project in GCP to manage your BigQuery resources.

4. **Load Datasets**
   - Upload or connect the two datasets you want to analyze within BigQuery.

5. **Write and Execute Queries**
   - Click on the blue `+` button to open a new query editor.
   - Use SQL to query your datasets and extract insights.

## Example Query
Refer to the `Query.sql` file in this repository for an example of how to write SQL queries in BigQuery and access tables effectively.
